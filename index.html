                    <span id="about"> Howdy! My name is Mitchell Sappington and I am a junior computer science major at Texas A&M University. My involvement in clubs, hackathons, passion projects, and my summer internship have given me experience in both casual and professional software development environments. In addition to my passion for software, I also love music. I have played guitar since I was in elementary school and am a founding member of a music club here at Texas A&M. This has been an excellent opportunity since it has allowed me to combine my two passions by creating a music related website. </span> <br> <br>
