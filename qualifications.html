                        <span>I have experience with Full Stack web development but definitely prefer the backend. I have experience working in Node.js Express backends through my work developing a website for my club. I also worked in a C# backend environment in my internship over the summer at BNSF Logistics. I love finding creative solutions to logical problems. </span>

                        <span>Through the development of my personal projects and my involvement in the TAMU Robomaster Computer Vision team, I have had many opportunities to learn about image processing. I have extensive experience with the OpenCV package in Python and enjoy learning about new new techniques that allow computers to interact with the world around them through imaging. I am also interested in the role it plays in the future of machine learning. </span>

                        <span>This past summer I got the opportunity to work in an IT Business Intelligence role at BNSF Logistics. This exposed me to many data science tools such as Pandas and Scikit in Python. I had a great time working with data, creating models, and finding trends that could drive business growth. I have also gained machine learning experience through self driven research and personal projects and my involvement in TAMU Robomaster, where we use a convolutional neural network to identify opponents. I am excited to see how the role of data science and machine learning will change software in the future.</span>

                        <span>Working in my Business Intelligence role in my internship over the summer, I was able to gain a lot of insight on how databases are designed. All data I wanted had to be queried from the database, which resulted in a lot of complex queries being written in multiple different SQL flavors. I also worked closely with a database engineer that walked me through the inner workings of the database and all the thought that went into creating and updating it. I am also taking a database design class this semester to further learn how to create efficient databases. </span>
